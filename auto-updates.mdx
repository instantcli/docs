When your API docs change, InstantCLI diffs the new version against the last crawled version, updates only what changed, and pushes an update.

## How it works

Your CLI checks for updates in the background when you run a command, up to once every four hours. If a new version is available, it notifies you to install it. This check is non-blocking — it won't slow down your commands.

## Manual updates

You can trigger an update manually at any time:

```bash
your-cli update
```
