Auto-updates are included with the monthly plan ($19/month). When your API docs change, InstantCLI regenerates your CLI and pushes an update automatically.

## How it works

Your CLI checks for updates in the background when you run a command. If a new version is available, it downloads and installs it automatically. This check is non-blocking — it won't slow down your commands.

## Manual updates

You can trigger an update manually at any time:

```bash
your-cli update
```

## Disabling update checks

If you want to disable automatic update checks, set the `NO_UPDATE_CHECK` environment variable:

```bash
NO_UPDATE_CHECK=true your-cli users list
```

Or export it in your shell profile to disable permanently:

```bash
export NO_UPDATE_CHECK=true
```
