Your CLI stores configuration locally so you don't have to pass flags on every command.

## Setting your API key

```bash
your-cli config set api-key sk-your-key-here
```

Once set, all commands will use this key automatically. You can still override it per-command with `--api-key`.

## Setting the base URL

If you need to point your CLI at a different server (e.g., staging):

```bash
your-cli config set base-url https://api.staging.example.com
```

## Config file location

Configuration is stored as JSON at:

```
~/.config/your-cli/config.json
```

You can edit this file directly if you prefer.

## Environment variables

You can also configure your CLI with environment variables. These take precedence over the config file but are overridden by flags.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `YOUR_CLI_API_KEY` | API key for authentication |
| `YOUR_CLI_BASE_URL` | Override the default API base URL |

<Note>
The exact environment variable names depend on your CLI's name. Check `your-cli --help` for the specific variable names.
