After your CLI is generated, you'll get a one-line install command. You can always find it in your [InstantCLI dashboard](https://instantcli.com).

## macOS and Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL get.instantcli.com/your-slug/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the correct binary for your platform and architecture, and adds it to your `PATH`.

## Windows

```powershell
irm get.instantcli.com/your-slug/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Verify the installation

After installing, verify everything is working:

```bash
your-cli --version
```

## Updating

If you're on the monthly plan, your CLI updates automatically. You can also update manually at any time:

```bash
your-cli update
```

See [Auto-updates](/auto-updates) for more details.
