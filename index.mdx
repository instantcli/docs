InstantCLI takes your API documentation URL and generates a fully functional command-line tool. You get native binaries, install scripts, auto-updates, and full source code — all from a single URL.

## What you get

- **Native binaries** for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **One-line install scripts** for easy distribution
- **Auto-updates** so your CLI stays current when the API changes
- **Full source code** you own and can customize
- **Smart command structure** that mirrors your API's resources and actions
