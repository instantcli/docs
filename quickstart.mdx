<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [instantcli.com](https://instantcli.com) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste your API docs URL">
    Enter the URL of your API documentation. InstantCLI supports OpenAPI/Swagger specs, developer docs pages, and most common API documentation formats.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for crawl and extraction">
    InstantCLI crawls your docs and extracts endpoints, parameters, and authentication details. This typically takes 2–3 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the generated plan">
    You'll see a plan showing the commands, resources, and actions your CLI will include. Review it and request revisions if anything needs adjusting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve and pay">
    Once you're happy with the plan, approve it. Pricing is either **$19 one-time** or **$19/month** with auto-updates included.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install and use your CLI">
    Copy the install command from your dashboard and run it:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL get.instantcli.com/your-slug/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Your CLI is ready to use. Run `your-cli --help` to see available commands.
