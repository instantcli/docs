<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What API docs formats are supported?">
    InstantCLI supports all API docs formats, including OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. If your docs are publicly accessible, we can parse them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does generation take?">
    The generation process takes ~7 minutes on average. Larger APIs with many endpoints will take longer. You can navigate away safely — we'll email you when your CLI is ready.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I get the source code?">
    Yes. You receive full source code for your generated CLI. You can inspect it, modify it, and host it yourself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What platforms are supported?">
    Generated CLIs support macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64 and ARM64), and Windows (x86_64).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the generated CLI?">
    Yes. You own the source code and can modify it however you like. You can download a zip file of your repo any time from the [dashboard](https://instantcli.com/dashboard).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What language are the CLIs written in?">
    All CLIs are written in Go. We chose Go over Node.js-based CLI frameworks (like Commander.js or oclif) because Go compiles to lightweight, standalone binaries — no runtime dependencies, fast startup, easy installation on every platform.
