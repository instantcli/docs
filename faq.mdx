<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What API docs formats are supported?">
    InstantCLI supports all API docs formats, including OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. If your docs are publicly accessible, we can parse them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does generation take?">
    The crawl and extraction process typically takes 2–3 minutes. Larger APIs with many endpoints may take slightly longer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I get the source code?">
    Yes. You receive full source code for your generated CLI. You can inspect it, modify it, and host it yourself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What platforms are supported?">
    Generated CLIs support macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64 and ARM64), and Windows (x86_64).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the generated CLI?">
    Yes. You own the source code and can modify it however you like. If you're on the monthly plan, be aware that auto-updates will overwrite your changes — so fork the code if you plan to customize extensively.
